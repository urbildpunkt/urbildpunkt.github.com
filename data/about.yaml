  description: | 
    I am an open source enthusiast, privacy advocate, and design fanatic. My passion lies at the intersection of art, technology, and culture. I have explored how technology can have an important role in improving people's lives, and I want to help design these interactions. I am looking for full time roles where I can take pride in making a real difference in people's lives and the ways in which they interact with technology.

  description: | 
    Using a homemade arduino programmed with a gps and accelerometer sensor, I prototyped a discrete, wearable device that could detect the motions of a grand mal seizure and call out for help at a time when the wearer himself could not, hopefully bringing back a sense of security and independence.

    A physical wind chime that reacted instead to “digital wind.” A lot of the focus was put on the aesthetic, I wanted to create an “appliance-like” device that would feel at home on a desk in the same way that a nice clock might.

    For my senior project, I chose to create a Mozilla Popcorn-based “hypervideo” exploring the relationship between social media and politics through the events of the Egyptian revolution that began on the 25 of January, 2011. <p>I was asked to present the final product at the 2012 Best of ICAM presentation.</p>
