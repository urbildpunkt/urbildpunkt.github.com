    A spec work interview assignment redesigning the Starcraft II World Championship Series community website. Since the video player is a main point of focus for visitors, I wanted to explore also making it a main point of focus for navigation and content. I created a sidebar panel that allows the viewer to access relevant information or browse for additional content without interrupting the display of the video.
      <blockquote class="small">"We loved your response. We would like to proceed with the next phase of the interview."</blockquote>

    A conceptual user interface and website redesign that I created for the free, open source, and cross-platform massively multiplayer online game PlaneShift during my short stint on the development team. While it never officially made it into the game, I did develop a working mod version at the time.
