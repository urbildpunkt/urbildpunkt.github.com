    A spec work interview assignment redesigning the StarCraft II World Championship Series community website. Since the video player is a main point of focus for visitors, I wanted to explore also making it a main point of focus for navigation and content. I created a sidebar panel that allows the viewer to access relevant information or browse for additional content without interrupting the display of the video.
